# FIle-Mover
Cut and move files from location A to location B.
 
A tool made to move files from six different locations to one or six new locations.
Primarily used for moving files that arrive via services into the incorrect directories,
grouping them up and processing them in the correct directory, instead of manualy dragging
and dropping files from all six directories.

Date and time selection is added due to the fact that the files that are being moved needed 
to be moved every X amount of days. Selection of files via date and time can further be narrowed 
down to moving only files that have been modified in that time span, or files that have been
created in that time span.
